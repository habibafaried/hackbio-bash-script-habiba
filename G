Interpretation of Identified Mutations

rs34126315 (HBB, Glu6Val, chr11:5225469 A>T)
This is the canonical HbS mutation in the β-globin gene. It substitutes valine for glutamic acid at codon 6, producing hemoglobin S. Under low oxygen, HbS polymerizes, distorting red cells into a sickle shape. This leads to vaso-occlusion, hemolysis, anemia, and painful crises. The variant is pathogenic and is the primary cause of Sickle Cell Disease when present in a homozygous state (HbSS) or in combination with another pathogenic allele (e.g., HbC, β-thalassemia).

rs34135787 (HBB, Glu6Lys, chr11:5225531 C>T)
This variant also alters the same codon but replaces glutamic acid with lysine, producing hemoglobin C (HbC). HbC alone causes mild hemolytic anemia, but in combination with HbS (HbSC disease), it produces a sickling disorder with vaso-occlusive symptoms. It is classified as pathogenic.

rs33941849 (HBB, Glu6Val, chr11:5225518 A>T)
Another reference entry for the HbS mutation, describing the same amino-acid substitution (Glu6Val). It is likewise pathogenic and clinically associated with Sickle Cell Disease.

Clinical Summary

All three reported variants point to mutations at codon 6 of the β-globin gene (HBB), which is the critical site for sickle hemoglobin. The presence of these variants explains Patient X’s clinical presentation of chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusive pain episodes, and jaundice, fully consistent with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).

Do you want me to now condense this into a short one-paragraph summary that you can directly paste as your interpretation in the HackBio project?
